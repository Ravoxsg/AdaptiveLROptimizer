## Faster gradient descent via an adaptive learning rate

This repo contains code for work done by Mathieu Ravut and Satya Krishna Gorti.

In this project we show a new adaptive learning rate algorithm on gradient descent and explore its effectiveness on the following tasks:

* Linear regression using Boston Housing Prices dataset
* Logistic regression using MNIST dataset
* Image Classification with neural networks using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
